# Checkers!

This project was coded by Yago Mart√≠nez.


# File structure

The repository has two main parts:

 - Obsidian: This is my custom 3d game engine developed using LWJGL. Unfortunately, I couldn't use it as I couldn't fully implement the Raycasting function and so you are not able to select a piece and move it.
 - 2D: This package contains the final project itself. This is just a 2d version of the 3d project. 

## Important considerations

 - Gradle:
	 - This project is created with Gradle, you **won't** need it for the 2D part but you **will** need it for the 3d part
## How to build via Gradle.

I would highly recommend using Intellij idea IDE. Intellij idea is a modern IDE developed for java, it has a great library of plugins including one for Gradle making it a great alternative to Eclipse. It also has a free version called Intellij Idea community. You can get your hands over Intellij for free on its website: [Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
If you have Eclipse you should be able to run it normally.
